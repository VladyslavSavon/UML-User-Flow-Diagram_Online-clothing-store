An UML User Flow Diagram of an online clothing store

## Short description of the diagram

A user flow diagram is designed to visualize the path a user takes through the system's processes. It demonstrates how users navigate within the product to achieve their goals.

The example presents two user flow diagrams:

First Diagram – It visualizes the journey of a user visiting an online clothing store for the first time. The site offers multiple registration options or the choice to continue without registering. Additionally, the diagram includes the path of a returning user who needs to log in to access their profile. In this case, the user’s goal is to gain access to the content available on the site.

Second Diagram – It illustrates the journey of a user who begins searching for a specific product. Users may have various goals, such as browsing available items, checking prices, searching for a particular product, or making a purchase. This list is not exhaustive and can be expanded as user requirements are refined.

These diagrams represent one way to use UML modeling to create a clear structure for user navigation within the website. They serve not only as a tool for stakeholder presentations but also for internal use, helping teams better understand the product and stay aligned.
